## Gatsby
I used Gatsby.js for its ability to generate static sites with ease. There's no runtime rendering, server-side code nor databases to deal with, which makes it extremely fast.

If you would like to learn Gatsby, full documentation can be found [on Gatsby's website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

### Themes

I'm using the Gatsby Theme [`gatsby-theme-cara`](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/master/themes/gatsby-theme-cara).
To learn more about Gatsby themes, check out the [theme docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/).
